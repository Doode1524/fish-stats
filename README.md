TO SET UP JSON SERVER:

- Install node package manager by typing `npm install -g npm` in your terminal.
- Install JSON server by typing `npm install -g json-server` in your terminal.
- Create a file called `db.json` in the root directory of your project.
- Add the JSON viewer chrome extension by visiting https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en-US
- To run JSON server, type `json-server --watch db.json` in your terminal.
- JSON server runs on default port 3000, so to visit it in your browser, go to  `http://localhost:3000` for the root endpoint.
